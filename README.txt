Size of empty project after just git cloning corrade and magnum: 27.5 MB.
After building something that just makes a gray screen: 134 MB.


TODO:
1. Work through several example projects.
2. Learn about instancing through magnum interface.
3. Create some 3D models and import them using assimp in magnum.
4. Make a couple toy projects e.g. visualizing 2D/3D graphs.
5. Use the magnum framework to develop a simulation engine for various purposes (e.g. Finite element, finite difference, rigid body simulations,...).

End goal:
- Create a project that I can put on github and be proud of.
